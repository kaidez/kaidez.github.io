I lost my <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> blog because I deleted the database by mistake. So I had to rebuild it quickly to keep from losing the little "<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/link-juice-improving-google-ranking-with-links/">link juice</a>" I have.

My day job's kept me busy, making me work some late nights and (sometimes) on the weekend. Consequently, I haven't had time to document this 2017 rebuilding process until now...towards the end of 2017.

<h2>Developing with the K.I.S.S. Method</h2>
This was, above all, the core foundation of my web development process for this redesign.  K.I.S.S.: Keep It Simple, Stupid.

I've been lucky enough to work for a variety of great companies over the course of my career. From this variety, I've learned that I work best on teams that prefer simplicity in web development over trend-chasing.

This is not to say I don't try and learn new stuff: I do that in the evening hours. But while on the job, I prefer web dev tools and techniques that help me get the job done fast instead of the ones trending on Twitter at the time.

Hence, this is how I approached redesigning my blog: just using the tools what I needed to get things done.  I didn't want to do complex coding things just so I could say "I did complex coding things."

<h2>Jekyll...Again</h2>
I used the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a> for <a href="/site-redesign-2013/">2013 site redesign</a> because I wanted to try Jekyll. For my <a href="/site-redesign-2015/">2015 site redesign</a>, I went back to WordPress so I use it's rich ecosystem of plugins for managing things like SEO and 301 redirects.

But as mentioned, I had to get this 2017 version up ASAP...using Jekyll was faster than using WordPress. And I have to say that Jekyll has really <em>really</em> improved since the last time I used it.

First of all, Jekyll builds out the entire site fast...REALLY fast...faster than the last time I used it! It also has great <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/ ">Sass</a> integration, with Sass being my preferred CSS preprocessor.

But what's REALLY impressive is how much <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#available-plugins">Jekyll's plugins ecosystem</a> has grown since I used it last. It has plugins for gallery creation, Twitter card conversion, tag building, etc.

My blog uses four plugins:

<ol>
  <li class="post-list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag">Jekyll SEO Tag</a>: lets you add canonical URLs, <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph configs</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">JSON-LD</a> and some other SEO like stuff to your Jekyll site</li>
  <li class="post-list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from">JekyllRedirectFrom</a>: configure 301 redirects for single page or post.</li>
  <li class="post-list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap">Jekyll Sitemap Generator Plugin</a>: create a sitemaps.org-compliant sitemap for your Jekyll site.</li>
  <li class="post-list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate">Jekyll::Paginate</a>: Jekyll's default pagination plugin...no longer under development so I'll ~probably~ to get rid of it eventually.</li>
</ol>

These are mostly based around SEO but I may take a peek at the other Jekyll plugins.  But in general, mad props to the Jekyll community for making it easy to extend Jekyll overall.
