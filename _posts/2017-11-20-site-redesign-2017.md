I lost my <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> blog because I deleted the database by mistake. So I had to rebuild it quickly to keep from losing the little "<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/link-juice-improving-google-ranking-with-links/">link juice</a>" I have.

My day job's kept me busy, making me work some late nights and (sometimes) on the weekend. Consequently, I haven't had time to document this 2017 rebuilding process until now: towards the end of 2017.

<h2>Developing with the K.I.S.S. Method</h2>
This was, above all, the core foundation of my web development process for this redesign.  K.I.S.S.: Keep It Simple, Stupid.

I'm fortunate to have worked for a variety of great companies over the course of my career. From this variety, I've learned that I work best on teams that prefer simplicity in web development over trend-chasing.

This is not to say I don't try and learn new stuff: I do that at night. But while on the job, I prefer web dev tools and techniques that help me get the job done fast instead of the ones trending on Twitter at the time.

Hence, this is how I approached rebuilding my blog: just using the tools I needed to get things done.  I didn't want to do complex coding things just so I could say "I did complex coding things."

<a name="jekyll-again"></a>
<h2>Jekyll...Again</h2>
I used the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a> for <a href="/site-redesign-2013/">2013 site redesign</a> because I wanted to try Jekyll. For my <a href="/site-redesign-2015/">2015 site redesign</a>, I went back to WordPress so I could use its rich ecosystem of plugins for managing things like SEO and 301 redirects.

But as mentioned, I had to get this 2017 version up ASAP, and using Jekyll was faster than using WordPress. And I have to say that Jekyll has really <em>really</em> improved since the last time I used it.

First of all, Jekyll builds out the entire site fast...faster than the last time I used it! It also now has great <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/ ">Sass integration</a>, with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> being my preferred CSS preprocessor.

But what's REALLY impressive is how much <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#available-plugins">Jekyll's plugins ecosystem</a> has grown since I used it last. It has plugins for gallery creation, Twitter card conversion, tag building, etc.

My blog uses four plugins:

<ol>
  <li class="post__list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag">Jekyll SEO Tag</a>: lets you add  <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph configs</a>, canonical URLs, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">JSON-LD configs</a> and other SEO stuff to your Jekyll site</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from">JekyllRedirectFrom</a>: configure 301 redirects for single page or post.</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap">Jekyll Sitemap Generator Plugin</a>: create a <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/">sitemaps.org</a> compliant sitemap for your Jekyll site.</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate">Jekyll::Paginate</a>: Jekyll's default pagination plugin...no longer under development so I'll ~probably~ to get rid of it eventually.</li>
</ol>

These are mostly based around SEO but I may take a peek at the other Jekyll plugins.  But in general, mad props to the Jekyll community for making it easy to extend Jekyll overall.

<h2>Free Hosting with GitHub Pages</h2>
In terms site hosting, I was a loyal <a href="https://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a> customer for almost a decade. But because I had to get my site back up fast, I had to go with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.

This way was faster because 1) Jekyll has awesome GitHub Pages integration, and 2) I already have <a href="https://github.com/kaidez">a GitHub account</a>. As a result, rebuilding <em>most</em> of my blog and deploying it to a production-ready host took me all of three minutes...updating my blogs's DNS settings took longer.

This speed and ease cascades down to my workflow. First, I do my updates on a <a href="https://github.com/kaidez/kaidez.github.io/tree/dev-branch">development branch</a> that runs on Jekyll's local web server, making things browser-accessible.

When things are ready to go live, I merge the dev branch into the master branch on GitHub. This automatically pushes the updates to the live blog.

Furthermore, GitHub Pages is free, saving me almost <strong>$400USD a year</strong>!

<a name="site-speed"></a>
<h2>Site Speed is "Fine", But Not "Perfect"</h2>
Again, Jekyll is a static site generator. Meaning that each page on my site is an HTML file instead of being dynamically created from a back-end database.

So the site loads pretty fast as a result, but GitHub Pages <em>is</em> shared hosting...powerful shared hosting but shared hosting nonetheless. As as result, there are some things I can't do to make the site faster:

<ul>
  <li class="post__list-item"><strong>No server config files allowed</strong>: GitHub Pages doesn't let you use of things <code>.htaccess</code>, <code>web.config</code> or <code>nginx.conf</code> files. So I can't apply good file caching and apply far-future expiration dates to images, JavaScript files, CSS files, etc.</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><strong>No CDN</strong>: my previous site used <a href="https://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN (now called StackPath)</a> to serve assets...GitHub Pages doesn't allow for that also.</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><strong>Can't use HTTP/2</strong>: if there was <em>one</em> thing that would've made me walk away from GitHub Pages, it was this. I was really pumped to use the newer, faster, easy-to-use <a href="https://http2.github.io/">HTTP/2 protocol</a> but GH Pages doesn't allow it. And since, I'm using a custom domain name, GH Pages won't even let me do HTTPS.</li>
</ul>

With the exception of HTTP/2, these things have led to low scores on <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a>, <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a>. But I'm really not worried about that: the site is static and things are minified, making the site fast enough.

Still, the "no-HTTP/2-or HTTPS" thing kind of bugs me.  That MIGHT make we walk away from GitHub Pages at some point...just being honest here.

<em>(Note: Rebecca Murphey has <a href="https://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/11/25/building-for-http2">an excellent post about HTTP/2</a> if you're unfamiliar with it.)</em>

<h2>Practicing With the Rest</h2>
While I did use more complicated tools and techniques, I didn't use them too extensively. I just used them get more familiar with them.

Those tools were:
<ol>
  <li class="post__list-item"><strong>BEM CSS</strong>: I've been focused on the using  component-based CSS design patterns in my work. The one I love most is <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM (Block Element Modifier)</a>. It pretty much follows the <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">OOCSS</a> way of doing things but with a stricter naming convention: It's a <em>de facto</em> industry standard now so I implemented it for practice.</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><strong>React</strong>: Also for practice, I created two <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React components</a>: the menu and the footer. Very basic: no <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> or <a href="https://gist.github.com/abhiaiyer91/aaf6e325cf7fc5fd5ebc70192a1fa170">selector patterns</a> or anything like that...just practicing React.</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><strong>webpack</strong>: I was completely fine using <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> for modularizing JS files but <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> has also evolved into web standard.</li>
  <li class="post__list-item"><strong>Yarn</strong>: Same thing here: I was completely fine using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> as my core package manager, but everyone prefers <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> now. To be fair: Yarn is faster and did some things better than npm in terms of caching. Also, to be fair, npm has since improved itself in terms of speed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The K.I.S.S. Method, Revisted</h2>
My previous site updates were much more grander than this, but I'm really about simplicity now. Especially when it comes to the tools I use.
