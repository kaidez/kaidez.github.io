On August 26th 2025, Stanford University released a report on how generative AI, or AI, is affecting the labor market.  It had six key findings, the first being that there were "substantial declines in employment for early-career workers (ages 22-25) in occupations most exposed to AI."

According to the report's findings, software development was listed as one of the most exposed career fields (alongside customer service). So, for now, young entry-level workers should consider gaining tech experience before pursuing their first real technology job.

## Younger, Entry-Level Workers vs. Older, Experienced Workers

found that AI tools could effectively perform tasks usually done by entry level workers.  At the same time, there was a "a 6% decline in employment from late 2022 to July 2025 in the most AI-exposed occupations."  

However, there was "a 6-9% increase [in employment] for older workers" in these same occupations.  From this, concludes that "declining employment AI-exposed jobs is driving tepid overall employment growth for 22- to 25- year-olds as employment for older workers continues to grow."

## What Entry-Level Workers Can Do

Job opportunities in tech fluctuate; sometimes there are tons of open positions and sometimes there are very few.  At the time of this blog post, there are fewer opportunities due to a whole lot of industry-wide layoffs.
