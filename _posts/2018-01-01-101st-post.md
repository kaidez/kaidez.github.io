Happy New Year!

For this first day of 2018, I'm publishing my 101st post: time to look at my developer career in retrospect. You would THINK that a retrospective like this would be the 100th post and it would, but here's what happened:

As mentioned many times, I lost my entire blog by mistakenly deleting the database. With some help from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/kaidez.com">Internet Wayback Machine</a>, I was able to recover all but two posts.

One post was on <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a web dev job in 2017</a> and the other was on <a href="/learn-javascript-unit-testing/">JavaScript unit testing</a>. These didn't appear on the IWM, but I was able to recall most of the job search one from memory and rewrite it.

I planned on rewriting the unit test one but kept writing new posts anyway, totalling 99 posts in all. As I began to write post 100, I checked my site on IWM...by chance.

Lo and behold, the unit post was there now! I added it back to my blog, which meant my already-published <a href="/temperatures-functional-programming/">JavaScript functional programming on temperatures</a> was post 100!

So my retrospective post is Post #101 now.  It happens...OK...off to the review.

<h2>The <em>BIGGEST</em> thing I've learned as a web developer</h2>
At the time of this post, I've been a professionally employed web developer for just over 12 years. The fundamental thing I've learned in this time is, the only way to get better as a developer is to "just code."

<a href="/write-code-every-f-king-day/">I've written about this before</a> but it bears repeating.
