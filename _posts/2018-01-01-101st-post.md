Happy New Year!

For this first day of 2018, I'm publishing my 101st post: time to look at my developer career in retrospect. You would THINK that a retrospective like this would be the 100th post and it would, but here's what happened:

As mentioned many times, I lost my entire blog by mistakenly deleting the database. With some help from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/kaidez.com">Internet Wayback Machine</a>, I was able to recover all but two posts.

One post was on <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a web dev job in 2017</a> and the other was on <a href="/learn-javascript-unit-testing/">JavaScript unit testing</a>. These didn't appear on the IWM, but I was able to recall most of the job search one from memory and rewrite it.

I planned on rewriting the unit test one but kept writing new posts anyway, totalling 99 posts in all. As I began to write post 100, I checked my site on IWM...by chance.

Lo and behold, the unit post was there now! I added it back to my blog, which meant my already-published <a href="/temperatures-functional-programming/">JavaScript functional programming on temperatures</a> was post 100!

So my retrospective post is Post #101 now.  It happens...OK...off to the review.

<h2>The <em>BIGGEST</em> thing I've learned as a web developer</h2>
At the time of this post, I've been a professionally employed web developer for just over 12 years. The fundamental thing I've learned in this time is, the only way to get better as a developer is to "just code."

<a href="/write-code-every-f-king-day/">I've written about this before</a> but it bears repeating. To learn new web dev stuff, you have to write code more than you do anything else.

More than read books about code, or watch videos about code, or pay for coding classes. You have to literally write code, make mistakes when you do it, and figure out how to fix them.

I paid for books, watched videos, paid for code courses...even shelled out my own money going to conferences. JSConf 2013? Where a majority of web developers were first exposed to React after Facebook open-sourced it? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW0rj4sNH2w">I was there</a>.

This was all good but I ended up doing this more than writing actual code, which was a mistake. When I stopped doing all this and wrote code instead, even if it was throw-away, it was then that I became a better developer.

I wrote CodePens and GitHub repos of stuff I never used. <a href="/kdz-build-tool/">I wrote a Node command-line tool</a> that I never used after I built it...despite publicly saying I would.

I don't care: I learned stuff from all those throwaways and got to be a better developer.

To be clear: I'm not saying <em>don't</em> learn from books, videos classes and conferences...we all learn differently. I'm saying write code <em>more</em> than you do those things...doing the opposite is a major mistake I've made.
