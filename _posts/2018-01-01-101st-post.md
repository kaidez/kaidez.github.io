Happy New Year!

For the first day of 2018, I'm publishing my 101st post: time to look at my developer career in retrospect. You would THINK that a retrospective like this would be the 100th post and it would usually, but here's what happened:

As mentioned many times, I lost my entire blog by mistakenly deleting its database. With some help from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/kaidez.com">Internet Wayback Machine</a>, I recovered all but two blog posts.

One post was on <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a web dev job in 2017</a> and the other was on <a href="/learn-javascript-unit-testing/">JavaScript unit testing</a>. These didn't appear on the IWM, but I was able to recall enough of the job search one from memory to rewrite it.

I planned on rewriting the unit test one but kept writing new posts anyway, eventually totalling 99 posts in all. As I began to write post 100, I checked my site on IWM...by chance.

Lo and behold, the unit post appeared now! I added it back to my blog, which meant my already-published post on <a href="/temperatures-functional-programming/">using JavaScript functional programming to calculate temperatures</a> was post 100!

So this retrospective post ends up being Post #101.  It happens...OK...off to the review.

<h2>The <em>BIGGEST</em> thing I've learned as a web developer</h2>
At the time of this post, I've been a professionally employed web developer for just over 12 years. The fundamental thing I've learned in this time is, the only way to get better as a developer is to "<strong>just code.</strong>"

<a href="/write-code-every-f-king-day/">I've written about this before</a> but it bears repeating. To learn new web dev stuff, you have to write code more than you do anything else.

More than read books about code, or watch videos about code, or pay for coding classes. You have to literally write code, make mistakes as you do it, and figure out how to fix them.

I paid for books, watched videos, paid for code courses.  I've even shelled tons of money going to conferences...For example:

JSConf 2013? Where a majority of web developers were first exposed to React? <em>Almost immediately</em> after Facebook open-sourced it? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW0rj4sNH2w">I was there!!!</a>

On one hand, it was great that "I was there." On the other hand, being "there" didn't teach me React, and I didn't even <em>use</em> it until three-and-a-half years later!

I now use React almost daily now and I'm proud of my knowledge of the library...knowledge I got by trying, building and failing with it. I'm not a React guru (yet), but I can take a React project on now with a high level of confidence.

This isn't just true with me and React: I've written CodePens and GitHub repos of stuff I've thrown away. <a href="/kdz-build-tool/">I wrote a Node command-line tool</a> that I never used after I built it...despite publicly saying I would.

I don't care: I learned stuff from all those throwaways and got to be a better developer. "Just coding" for the sake of "just coding" upped my confidence as a developer.

To be clear: I'm not saying <em>don't</em> learn from books, videos classes and conferences...we all learn differently. I'm saying write code <em>more</em> than you do those things...doing the opposite is a major mistake I've made.

<h2>Change was good...and it was necessary</h2>
Evolving as a developer goes beyond learning the new hipster framework. It also includes seeking challenges in your work. Leaving Revlon was such a challenge...and it was the right thing to do.

I blogged about that <a href="/revlon/">here</a> and as I said then, leaving was a necessity. I was certainly writing the code I wanted to write, but the need for writing that code was starting to lessen in terms of what the company needed.

All true. But it was also true that Revlon, at that time, wasn't the modern code shop I wanted to work in.

I wanted to work in a more modern, JIRA-powered agile environment. I wanted to work with JSON APIs more often. I wanted Git to be the one and only source code management system I used.

I had to leave Revlon to get all this. And while leaving them was not something I was happy to do, I'll concede that I had to do it to be happy developer.

<h2>Change also taught me what I wanted as a developer</h2>
Regardless of what tools I wanted to use at Revlon, it goes without saying that I worked on one of the best teams ever while there. From management on down, there were WAAAAY more strong links in the chain than weak links.

This was hard to find when I left. I've been on two different teams at my new employer and found it there, but I never got the "teamwork vibe" at the spots in between because they weren't as collaborative.

I didn't have fun as result of all this. Every morning before going to work, you should be able to say "Yay!!! I get to go to work today!"

I lost this for a minute due to the teams I was on: they were all made of good developers, I just didn't vibe with as many as of them as I had hoped.

My best work and best learning happens when I'm on a team that works as a unit to a common goal and shares knowledge with one another. If a team has impatient "cowboy coders" that prefer to work alone, I want no part of that.

<h2>I should be more confident in my skills...the fact that I haven't is my fault</h2>
A confession: there was a really bad week when I thought I didn't want to be a web developer anymore.

I'd been struggling with code that couldn't wrap my head around and the deadline to complete it was fast-approaching. This led to the realization that I would ALWAYS have to be learning if I remained a web dev, or run the risk of not knowing something I should know.

This led to my having an anxiety-induced panic attack as well as going through four days of clinical depression. Then I got off my ass, saw a doctor, and made some changes.

The first change was to get back to the simple pleasure of learning new things I had when I started coding. React combined with Redux is a <em>totally</em> different way of writing front-end code...working with those two things pushed my mind in that direction helped me gain that pleasure again.

Next, I made my home workspace more comfortable. A clean, uncluttered desk made me WANT to learn new stuff when I needed to learn it...ironically, it looks almost <em>exactly</em> like my old Revlon workspace.

But the <em>biggest</em> change I made in my life was to start mindfulness-based meditating with the help of the awesome <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm app</a>. This, more than anything,
