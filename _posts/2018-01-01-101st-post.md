Happy New Year!

For the first day of 2018, I'm publishing my 101st post: time to look at my developer career in retrospect. You would THINK that a retrospective like this would be the 100th post and it would, but here's what happened:

As mentioned many times, I lost my entire blog by mistakenly deleting its database. With some help from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/kaidez.com">Internet Wayback Machine</a>, I recovered all but two blog posts.

One post was on <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a web dev job in 2017</a> and the other was on <a href="/learn-javascript-unit-testing/">JavaScript unit testing</a>. These didn't appear on the IWM, but I was able to recall most of the job search one from memory and rewrite it.

I planned on rewriting the unit test one but kept writing new posts anyway, totalling 99 posts in all. As I began to write post 100, I checked my site on IWM...by chance.

Lo and behold, the unit post appeared now! I added it back to my blog, which meant my already-published post on <a href="/temperatures-functional-programming/">using JavaScript functional programming to calculate temperatures</a> was post 100!

So this retrospective post ends up being Post #101.  It happens...OK...off to the review.

<h2>The <em>BIGGEST</em> thing I've learned as a web developer</h2>
At the time of this post, I've been a professionally employed web developer for just over 12 years. The fundamental thing I've learned in this time is, the only way to get better as a developer is to "<strong>just code.</strong>"

<a href="/write-code-every-f-king-day/">I've written about this before</a> but it bears repeating. To learn new web dev stuff, you have to write code more than you do anything else.

More than read books about code, or watch videos about code, or pay for coding classes. You have to literally write code, make mistakes as you do it, and figure out how to fix them.

I paid for books, watched videos, paid for code courses.  I've even shelled out my own money going to conferences.

For example, JSConf 2013? Where a majority of web developers were first exposed to React? <em>Almost immediately</em> after Facebook open-sourced it? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW0rj4sNH2w">I was there!!!</a>

On one hand, it was great that "I was there." On the other hand, being "there" didn't teach me React, and I didn't even <em>use</em> it until three-and-a-half years later!

I now use React almost daily now and I'm proud of my knowledge of the library...knowledge I got by trying, building and failing with it. I'm not a React guru (yet), but I can take a React project on now with a high level of confidence.

This isn't just true with me and React: I've written CodePens and GitHub repos of stuff I've thrown away. <a href="/kdz-build-tool/">I wrote a Node command-line tool</a> that I never used after I built it...despite publicly saying I would.

I don't care: I learned stuff from all those throwaways and got to be a better developer. "Just coding" for the sake of "just coding" upped my confidence as a developer...we'll talk about my confidence later.

To be clear: I'm not saying <em>don't</em> learn from books, videos classes and conferences...we all learn differently. I'm saying write code <em>more</em> than you do those things...doing the opposite is a major mistake I've made.
