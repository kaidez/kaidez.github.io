excerpt: Focusing on core JavaScript fundamentals is key to your growth as a developer. But you need to focus on JS libraries & frameworks as well.

My last 20 months as a JavaScript developer have included a period of self-assessment. Mostly, I've been focusing on <em>how</em> I write JS instead of the tools I use to write it.

I've also been looking at how other developers of all skill/experience levels write code, trying to learn from them. And while other developers are free to write code however they want, I've seen too many instances of their focusing on (what I think is) too much of the wrong stuff at the wrong time.
<h2>How this all began</h2>
It all started when I began working with React on my day job. Because of this, I see three positive things that React brings to the JS developer conversation:

1. <strong>manipulating app views with a state object</strong>: changing your app's view/state by changing a standard "key:value" object (and not the DOM) is cool.
2. <strong>enforcing functional programming</strong>: the idea that functions should be "small things" that do one thing well and are easy to test is put into effect with React.
3. <strong>thoughtful component model</strong>: I'm stealing that phrase from <a href="https://medium.com/bumpers/isnt-our-code-just-the-best-f028a78f33a9">Jacob Thornton's great React article</a> but he's right. When it comes to encapsulating chunks of UI in a single, reusable component, React does this pretty well.

These things are positive because they bring some computer science best practices to JavaScript development. And as JS has matured into a full-on application language and beyond making neat rollovers, bringing these practices in is great.
<h2>There will be naysayers</h2>
Like many things before and after it, React was immediately characterized as "JAJFLWYWCI" (Just-Another-JavaScript-Framework-Library-Whatever-You-Wanna-Call-It).

<h2>It took me a while to decide if I was going to write this.</h2>
This point of view is just that: a point view. And there are enough web developer POVs out there already on this subject.
