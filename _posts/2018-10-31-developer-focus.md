excerpt: Focusing on core JavaScript fundamentals is key to your growth as a developer. But you need to focus on JS libraries & frameworks as well.

My last 20 months as a JavaScript developer have been a period of self-assessment. Mostly, I've been focusing on <em>how</em> I write application code instead of the tools I use to write it.

I've also researched how other developers from all experience levels write code and have collectively learned great things from them. That being said, I've found too many instances of these developers focusing on (what I think is) too much of the wrong stuff in my research.
<h2>How this all began</h2>
It all started when I began working with React on a daily basis. As a result of this, I see three positive aspects that React brings to the JS developer conversation:

1. <strong>manipulating app views with a state object</strong>: changing your app's view/state by changing a standard "key:value" object (and not the DOM) is cool.
2. <strong>enforcing functional programming</strong>: the idea that functions should be "small things" that do one thing well and are easy to test is put into effect with React.
3. <strong>thoughtful component model</strong>: I'm stealing that phrase from <a href="https://medium.com/bumpers/isnt-our-code-just-the-best-f028a78f33a9">Jacob Thornton's great React article</a> but he's right. When it comes to encapsulating chunks of UI in a single, reusable component, React does this pretty well.

These things are positive because <strong>they bring some computer science best practices to JavaScript development</strong>. And as JS has matured into a full-on application language and beyond making neat rollovers, bringing these practices in is great.
<h2>There will be naysayers</h2>
Soon after its initial release, React was characterized as <strong>"JAJFLWYWCI" (Just-Another-JavaScript-Framework-Library-Whatever-You-Wanna-Call-It)</strong>.  Most comments aligned with at least one of these three categories:
<blockquote class="content--blockquote-margin">
"You're not doing professional programming when you use frameworks or libraries."
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="content--blockquote-margin">
"It's too steep of a learning curve."
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="content--blockquote-margin">
"React and things like it lead to code bloat."
</blockquote>

Some comments I engaged with (mostly online) and some I didn't. But they didn't really bothered me...at least, not to the point I felt compelled to write this post.

I had real-world web developer stuff to to deal with so I moved on.

<h2>What Kevin said</h2>
Then, maybe on a subconscious impulse, I re-read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324030838/http://randyluecke.tumblr.com:80/post/45915323813/im-done-with-the-web">Kevin Luecke's "I'm done with the web" article</a>. An article that bummed me out when I first read it four-and-a-half years ago.

Kevin expressed his frustration with why web developers were rejecting the use of JavaScript UI frameworks like Cappuccino and Ember. Despite the problems they solved, developers passed on them because of their ~seemingly~ large file sizes and steep learning curves.
