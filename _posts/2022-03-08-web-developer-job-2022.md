On May 8th, 2017, I wrote about <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">my search for a front end web developer job</a>. Five years to the day later, I'm publishing a post about what that job search looks like in 2022.

This new job search took effort but not as much as the previous one. But like before, I learned a lot about what it takes to get a web dev position these days.

<h2>What happened the last time I looked for a web dev job?</h2>
In 2017, I "cast a wide net," meaning I applied for lots of jobs inside a short time frame. I applied for so many jobs that I hit a point where I had four interviews in one day.

I had to do this because I had limited experience with the in-demand JavaScript frameworks of the day, particularly <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. At the time, I had over a decade of developer experience but was competing for jobs against people who had more of the required framework knowledge than I did.

So I cast that wide net to better my chances of getting hired. And once I got a job (at JPMorgan Chase), I began building up five years of solid, quantifiable React experience.

<h2>What happened when I looked for a web dev job <i>this</i> time?</h2>
Having that experience paid off when the time came for me to find a new job. I still casted a wide net, but it didn't have to be as wide as before.

The result: I applied for less than half the amount jobs this time. Plus, I found a job a bit faster.

I got hired by Blue Cross Blue Shield in under three weeks...that's <i>less</i> than the month it took me to get the Chase job. <i>And</i> I turned down two other job offers along the way!

<h2>The six things I learned</h2>
As I went through all of this, I discovered six things:

<ol>
<li class="post__list-item">
<h3><b>There are many open web developer jobs, but tragedy is the main reason why</b></h3>

<p>Covid-19 is horrible. It's caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, massive lockdowns that have crippled small businesses and the quarantining of most employees.</p>

<p>Consequently, employees were forced to work remotely for safety reasons. Also, consequently, employers had to hire more remote employees.</p>

<p>For web developers, who were technically set up to work remotely already, this was a job boom. They suddenly had job options available to them from around the world, not just in their hometown.</p>

<p>On the whole, US companies have always employed remote developers from other countries. But based what I saw, companies now seem more willing to hire stateside remote coders.</p>

<p>Hiring remotely has always made sense for businesses but the pandemic made that obvious. They could either hire devs at USD$100,000+ a year, rent them an office and maintain it with electricity, custodians, etc.</p>

<p>Or, they could just hire devs at USD$100,000+ a year.</p>

<p>Every job I applied for was either fully remote or hybrid. I certainly would have applied for in-office jobs as well, but none of the ones I applied to offered it.</p>

<p>So yes, developers have a lot of job options right now and companies are saving money. But the tragedy of Covid-19 is the reason for this.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm thankful to have these options but I wouldn't have them if Covid never happened. I'd be prefer not to have these options.</p>

<h3><b>The core skills required for web developer jobs has changed dramatically</b></h3>
<p>
Back in the early 2000's someone with strong <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> skills was guaranteed a high-paying front end web developer job. jQuery begat <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, which begat <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, which begat React, and so on and so forth.
</p>

<p>In other words, the required skills for FE web developer jobs changes rapidly...always has, always will. But the changes from my last job search to this one are those most radical ones I've ever seen.</p>

<p>Front end web developers with these skillsets are THE most employable at the time of this post:</p>

<ul>
<li class="post__list-item" style="list-style-type:disc;"><b>TypeScript:</b> It makes unit testing easier and lets those classically-trained Java/C++ developers ramp up on JS quicker. Speaking of testing...</li>
<li class="post__list-item" style="list-style-type:disc;"><b>JavaScript unit testing:</b> JavaScript was initially created to be a beginner's programming language so it didn't require a culture of unit testing. JS has matured past the beginner level, so this simplicity is gone. Almost all prospective employers expect some unit test knowledge among candidates...not guru-level knowledge but <i>some</i> knowledge.</li>
<li class="post__list-item" style="list-style-type:disc;"><b>React and its ecosystem:</b> We'll discuss this in depth in #3 on this list ;)</li>
<li class="post__list-item" style="list-style-type:disc;"><b>Angular version 2 and higher:</b> Many businesses added Angular to their codebases before React got big.  That legacy code is still out there and those businesses are hiring developers to maintain it as well as migrate it over to React.</li>
<li class="post__list-item" style="list-style-type:disc;"><b>Intermediate level JavaScript knowledge:</b> If you know React and/or Angular, then employers expect your JS knowledge to be better than basic. You should know how to use <code>fetch</code>, <code>try/catch</code> and how to get info from JS data structures using loops. All this should be second nature to you.</li>
<li class="post__list-item" style="list-style-type:disc;"><b>Code deployment via cloud-based apps and services:</b> We'll discuss this in depth #6 on this list ;)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="post__list-item">
<h3><b>React is the most in-demand library/framework...and it will stay that way for awhile</b></h3>

<p>After its release, React solved problems that developers never knew they had. It gave them a great way to "component-ize" the UI, rendered that UI fast and made application state easier to manage.</p>

<p>This resulted in a growing React ecosystem that includes <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>, <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">React Router</a> and <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. It also led to a vast, supportive React community of Slack channels, tutorial sites and web forums.</p>

<p>It's for all these reasons (and many more) that businesses of all sizes have adopted React. And want to hire developers that know it.</p>

<p>No exaggeration here: for almost every interview I had, "How long have I used React?" was the one of the first two questions I was asked. Followed by questions about my knowledge of the above-mentioned ecosystem.</p>

<p>The years-long debate over what's the best JavaScript framework continues. As a result, frameworks like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> are being hyped as better alternatives to React.</p>

<p>To be fair: each one does certain tasks better than React and their learning curves aren't as steep. But React came out before them, so the business world adopted it first.</p>

<p>React is firmly embedded in many company codebases and it's expensive to switch it out for something else. So any sort of Vue/Svelte dominance in the business world isn't happening anytime soon.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind while job searching.  There are certainly Vue and Svelte jobs available, especially at startups or if you're purely doing freelance work.</p>

<p>But if you're looking on LinkedIn or Indeed, you have more options available to you as a React developer. It will be a while before this changes.</p>

<h3><b>The algorithm tests are everywhere</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/faang/">FAANG companies</a> are known for the algorithm-based tests that interviewees must pass before getting hired by them. I took the Google one a few years ago and didn't make it (it's ok...I'm fine).</p>

<p>It used to be the FAANGs were the only companies requiring this test...not anymore. While interviewing, a gaming company, a betting site and a beauty manufacturer asked me to take the test.</p>

<p>My opinion is, this is the result of the large number of bootcamp graduates applying for web dev jobs. I mentioned in my 2017 article that bootcampers are at a disadvantage when it comes to job searching...I also mentioned that <a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/">Zac Holman thought this interviewing approach was bullsh*t.</a></p>

<p>But there are a lot of unfilled web developer jobs right now, and there are only so many qualified CompSci graduates available to fill them.  So the bootcampers are needed; therefore, these algo tests are needed.</p>

<p>Now, it must be said that some EXCELLENT coders are coming out of bootcamps. I know of two bootcamp grads that got hired by Spotify, a difficult place to get a job.</p>

<p>And Noam Sauer-Utley is a bootcamp grad who's written some of the BEST JavaScript algorithms explanations I've ever read. Read more of her stuff <a href="https://medium.com/@noamsauerutley">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to prep for these tests from a JS standpoint, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> is probably the easiest free resource right now. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">Geeks for Geeks</a> is next and is also free...a bit more structured towards the tests.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> is free and is probably the closet representation of what an algo test looks like. Lots of the tests I took were on HackerRank.</p>

<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a> has free content but also has a premium subscription of USD$35 a month. I bought the premium subscription at the suggestion of a Google developer and suggest it as well: you'll see lots of sample questions close to what you'll see on the tests.</p>

<p>Many suggest <a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book</a> but it's a big read. However, its chapter on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/">Big O notation</a> is excellent.</p>

<h3><b>The line dividing front end web developer jobs and a back end ones is getting smaller</b></h3>
<p>Some FE job openings I saw listed JavaScript and CSS as requires skills, as well as Python, Java, and .NET.</p>

<p>Technically, Python, Java and .NET aren't "back end languages", they just interact with the back end more than JavaScript does. Maybe the term "front end" now means "anything that doesn't require building an SQL database."</p>

<p>I dunno: maybe the listings of Python, Java and .NET in these skillsets were typos. But they were there so it's something to keep in mind as you build your skillset...especially when discussing Python.</p>

<p>A quick aside: I predicted that back end-level Node would be a required skillset in my 2017 article. I didn't see many Node server jobs in 2022, but I did take a coding test where I had to load JSON into a Node back end and fetch it with React.</p>

<p>So learning some Node stuff maybe worth your time. Creating a consumable REST API using Node on your own is good practice.</p>
</li>

<li class="post__list-item">
<h3><b>The line dividing front end web developer jobs and DevOps jobs is getting really REALLY small</b></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, knowing how to manage cloud-based services is desirable skillset. This is because DevOps, the rapid but safe deployment of code, is as common as Git commits in the web dev world.</p>

<p>Knowing how to configure an automated build/deployment process using things like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, etc. is rapidly becoming a required skill for FE devs. Currently, I only have better-than-basic knowledge of this stuff, which probably prevented my moving forward for a few interviews.</p>

<p>If you're a front end developer, you're using npm to manage app dependencies and Git to manage source code. Cloud services have a somewhat parallel process so spend some time learning them.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
My biggest takeaway from this recent job search is...
>"WOW...it's REALLY good to have React experience nowadays!!!"

I do have other skills but having React experience made this the easiest job search I ever went through!

Web developers have always needed to keep their skills fresh. But I was brutally reminded of this during this job hunt.

There's a sticky on my desktop listing the skills I need to learn/ramp up on...cloud stuff, Node, etc. I'll have to find time to do just that: I have no other choice.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
But finding time to ramp up on front end web dev skills is the only issue right now.  There's never been a better time to look for an FE web dev job...particularly if you know React.

For skilled front developers, looking for a job in 2022 is like picking up gold coins off the street. This may just be just a bubble that will pop someday, but it's how things are right now.
