On May 8th 2017, I wrote about <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">what it was like looking for a front end web developer job</a> at that time. Five years to the day later, I'm publishing a post about what that job search looks like in 2022.

This new job search wasn't as intense as the previous one, but it was intense enough. And like before, I learned a lot about what it takes to get a web dev position these days.

<h2>What happened the last time I looked for a web dev job?</h2>
When I was job hunting five years ago, I "cast a wide net," meaning I applied for a WHOLE lot of jobs in a small time frame. So much so that I hit a point where I had four interviews in one day.

I felt I had to do this because I had limited experience with the in-demand JavaScript frameworks of the day, especially <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. At the time, I had over a decade of web dev experience but was competing for jobs against people who had more of the required framework knowledge than I did.

So I cast that wide net to give myself a better chance of getting hired. And once I got a job (at JPMorgan Chase), I began building up five years of solid, quantifiable React experience.

That paid off when the time came for me to find a new job. I still cast a wide net while searching, but it didn't have to be as wide as before.

I estimate I applied for less than half the amount jobs this time. Plus, I found a job a bit faster...I got my new job at Blue Cross Blue Shield in just under three weeks, that's less than the four weeks it took me to get the Chase job.

As a result, here are six key things I discovered while job hunting:

<li class="post__list-item">
<h2>
There are many open web developer jobs, but understand that tragedy is the main reason why.</h2>

<p>Covid-19 is horrible: it's responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, led to massive lockdowns that have crippled small businesses and led to the quarantining of most employees.</p>

<p>Consequently, employees were forced to work remotely for safety reasons. Also, consequently, employers had to hire more remote employees.</p>

<p>For web developers, who were technically set up to work remotely already, this was a job boom. They suddenly had job options available to them from around the world, not just in their hometown.</p>

<p>For employers, they gained access to a wider talent pool. A startup in Tennessee could now hire a Silicon Valley-bred web developer if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Financially-speaking, this helped businesses...they no longer needed to hire 20 devs, pay them USD$100,000+ a year, lease them office space and then maintain it with electricity, custodians, etc. They just needed to hire 20 devs and pay them USD$100,000+ a year.</p>

<p>Every job I applied for was either fully remote or hybrid. I would have applied for in-office jobs, it's just that none of the ones I applied to offered that.</p>

<p>So yes, developers currently have options when they job-search...this may change some day but it's how it is now. However, the tragedy of Covid-19 is the reason for this.</p>

<p>I'm thankful to have a lot of options but I wouldn't have them if Covid never happened. In this case, I'd be fine if I didn't have a lot of options</p>

<h2>The core skills required for web developer jobs <i>always</i> changes</h2>
<p>
Back in the early 2000's someone with strong <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> skills was guaranteed a nice, high-paying front end web developer job. jQuery begat <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, which begat <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, and so on and so forth.
</p>

<p>The required skills for front end web developer jobs always changes rapidly. But based on the skills listed for the front end jobs I saw and the questions that interviewers asked me, the changes from my last job search to this one are those most radical ones I've ever seen.</p>

<p>Front end web developers with these skillsets are THE most employable at the time of this post:</p>

<ul>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>TypeScript:</em> It makes unit testing easier and lets those classically-trained Java/C++ developers ramp up on JS quicker. Speaking of testing...</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>JavaScript unit testing:</em> JavaScript was initially created to be a beginner's programming language so it didn't require a culture of unit testing. JS has matured from DOM manipulation to mobile apps, so such simplicity has passed. Almost all prospective employers expect some unit test knowledge among candidates...not guru-level knowledge but SOME knowledge.</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>React and its ecosystem:</em> We'll discuss this in depth in the next section ;)</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>Angular version 2 and higher:</em> Many businesses added Angular to their codebases before React got big.  That legacy code is still out there and those businesses are hiring developers to both maintain it as well as migrate it over to React.</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>Intermediate level JavaScript:</em> If you know React and/or Angular, then employers expect your JS knowledge to be better than basic. Implementing things like <code>fetch</code> and <code>try...catch</code> and ANYTHING related to JS data structures?  All that should be second nature to you.</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>Code deployment via cloud-based apps and services:</em> Knowing how to automate a build/deployment process using combinations of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, etc. is rapidly becoming a required skill. Ignore this if you want but if you currently use npm and Git to respectively manage app dependencies and source code, the growing expectation is you either already know how build/deploy within the cloud, or can learn how to do it relatively fast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>React is the most in-demand library/framework...and will stay that way for awhile</h2>
<p>React and its ecosystem of tools (Redux and React Router in particular) solved a lot of problems in the web dev world.</p>
