I wrote about <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a front end web development job in 2017</a>. Five years to the day later, I'm publishing a post about looking for an FE web dev job in 2022.

This job search wasn't as intense as the previous one. But it was intense enough and like before, I learned a lot about what it takes to get a web dev position these days.

<h2>What happened the last time I looked for a web dev job?</h2>
When I was job hunting five years ago, I "cast a wide net," meaning I applied for a WHOLE lot of jobs in a small time frame. So much so that I hit a point where I had four interviews in one day.

I felt I had to do that due to my limited experience with the in-demand JavaScript frameworks of the day, especially <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. I had over a decade of web dev experience at that time, but was competing for jobs against people that had more of the required framework knowledge than I did.

So I cast that wide net to give myself a better chance of getting a web development job. And once I got that job (at JPMorgan Chase), I began to build up five years of solid, quantifiable React experience.

And that paid off when I started looking for a new job. I may have casted a wide net for this recent job search, but it didn't need to be as wide as it was for the last one.

For this job search, I estimate I applied for less than half the amount jobs than the previous one. Plus, I found a job a bit faster...I got my new job at Blue Cross Blue Shield in just under three weeks, which is less than the four weeks it took me to get the Chase job.

As a result, here are six key things I discovered while job hunting:

<li class="post__list-item">
<h2>
There are many open web developer jobs, but understand that tragedy is the main reason why.</h2>

<p>Covid-19 is horrible: it's responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, led to massive lockdowns that have crippled small businesses and led to the quarantining of most employees.</p>

<p>Consequently, employees were forced to work remotely for safety reasons. Also, consequently, employers had to hire more remote employees.</p>

<p>For web developers, who were technically set up to work remotely already, this was a job boom. They suddenly had job options available to them from around the world, not just in their hometown.</p>

<p>For employers, they gained access to a wider talent pool. A startup in Tennessee could now hire a Silicon Valley-bred web developer if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Financially, this made sense for business...they no longer needed to hire 20 devs, pay them USD$100,000+ a year, lease them office space and then maintain it with electricity, custodians, etc. They just needed to hire 20 devs and pay them USD$100,000+ a year.</p>

<p>Every job I applied to was either fully remote or hybrid. I would have applied for in-office jobs, it's just that none of the ones I applied to offered that.</p>

<p>So yes, developers have options when they job search...this may change some day but it's how it is now. However, the tragedy of Covid-19 is the reason for this.</p>

<p>I'm thankful to have a lot of options but if Covid never happened, I wouldn't. I would be fine if I didn't have a lot of options</p>

<h2>Know the core skills required for a front web developer job, and that list always changes</h2>
<p>
Back in the early 2000's someone with strong <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> skills was guaranteed a nice, high-paying front end web developer job. jQuery begat <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, which begat <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, and so on and so forth.
</p>

<p>The required skills for front end web developer jobs change rapidly, and they always will. But based on the skills listed for the front end jobs I saw and the questions that interviewers asked me, the changes from my last job search to this one are those most radical ones I've ever seen.</p>

<p>Front end web developers with these skillsets are THE most employable at the time of this post:</p>

<ul>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>Intermediate-to-guru level JavaScript:</em> Closer to the intermediate side than the guru one, but it's required. Things like looping through arrays, implementing <code>try...catch</code> and using <code>async/await</code> should be second nature to you.</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>TypeScript:</em> It makes testing easier and lets developers traditionally trained in Java, C++, etc. ramp up on JS quickly. Speaking of testing...</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>Unit testing:</em> JavaScript was initially written to be a beginner programming language so it didn't require a culture of unit testing. JS has matured from DOM manipulation to mobile apps, so such simplicity has passed. Knowing how to use <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> alongside either <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/">Enzyme</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html">React Test Renderer</a> is the best skill to have.</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>React and its ecosystem:</em> We'll discuss this in depth in the next section :)</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>Angular version 2 and higher:</em> Lots of businesses added Angular to their codebases before React got big.  That legacy code is still out there and those businesses will hire developers to both maintain it as well as migrate over to React.</li>
<li class="post__list-item"><em>Cloud-based apps and services:</em> Knowing how to trigger a build process or deployment using a combination of AWS/Azure/Docker/Kubernates/whatever is on its way to becoming a required skill. Disagree if you like but if you know how to use npm to manage app dependencies and Git to manage source code control, you can learn how to use these tools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>React is the most in-demand library/framework...and will stay that way for awhile</h2>
<p>React and its ecosystem of tools (Redux and React Router in particular) solved a lot of problems in the web dev world.</p>
