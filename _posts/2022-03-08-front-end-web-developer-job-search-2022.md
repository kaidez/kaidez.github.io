I wrote a post about <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a web development job in 2017</a>. Five years to the day later, I'm publishing a post about looking for a web dev job in 2022.

This job search wasn't as intense as the previous one. But it was intense enough and like before, I learned a lot about what it takes to get a web dev position these days.

<h2>What happened the last time I looked for a web developer job</h2>
When I was job hunting five years ago, I "cast a wide net," meaning I applied for a WHOLE lot of jobs in little time. So much so that there was a day when I went on four interviews in one day.

I felt I had to do that due to my little experience with the in-demand JavaScript frameworks of the day, particularly <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. I had over a decade of web dev experience, but was competing for jobs against people with much more of the required framework knowledge than me.

So I cast that wide net to give myself a stronger chance of getting a web development job. But once I got that job at JPMorgan Chase, my framework experience grew exponentially.

I built up five solid, quantifiable years of React experience at while working at Chase...stateful/stateless components, Redux, hooks, etc. And that paid off when I started looking for a new job.

So I still casted a wide net and applied for a lot of jobs during this new job search. But significantly less than before...less than half I believe.

Also, I found a job a bit faster. It took less than three weeks for me to get my new job at Blue Cross Blue Shield, compared to the four weeks it took for me to get my job at Chase.

As a result, here's six key things I discovered:

<h2>
There are many open web developer jobs, but always respect that tragedy is the main reason why.</h2>

<p>Covid-19 is horrible: it's responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, led to massive lockdowns that have crippled small businesses and led to the quarantining of most employees.</p>

<p>Consequently, employees were forced to work remotely. Also, consequently, employers were willing to hire more remote employees.</p>

<p>For web developers, who were technically set up to work remotely already, this was a job boom. They suddenly had lots of job options outside of their hometown.</p>

<p>For employers, they gained access to a wider talent pool. A startup in Tennessee could now higher a Silicon Valley-bred web developer if the wanted to.</p>

<p>Financially, this made sense for business...they no longer needed to hire 20 devs, pay them USD$100,000+ a year, lease them office space and then maintain it with electricity, custodians, etc. They just needed to hire 20 devs and pay them USD$100,000+ a year.</p>

<p>Every job I applied to was either fully remote or hybrid. I would have applied for in-office jobs, it's just that none of the ones I applied to offered that.</p>

<p>Every job I applied to was either fully remote or hybrid. I would have applied for in-office jobs, it's just that none of the ones I applied to offered that.</p>

<p>So yes, developers have options when they job search...this may change some day but it's how it is now. However, the tragedy of Covid-19 is the reason for this.</p>

<p>I'm thankful to have a lot options but if Covid never happened, I wouldn't. I would be fine if I didn't have a lot of options<./p>
