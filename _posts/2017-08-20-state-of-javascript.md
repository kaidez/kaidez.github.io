React and Redux have demonstrated the value of well-implemented application state management in JavaScript to web developers. Despite this, developers complain about it.

I'd link to think the breakdown of developers that do and don't complain about React/Redux is 50/50, and that some of the complaints are valid. Nevertheless, good JavaScript state management was bound to happen, especially when reviewing how the language has progressed over the years.

<em>(Author's note: I used <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich">Brendan Eich's awesome interview on JS Jabber</a> as a reference to some of the historical stuff mentioned in this post...It's worth a listen.)</em>

<h3>In The Beginning...</h3>
This is the first JavaScript book I ever brought:

It was written by Dori Smith and the late, (very) great Tom Negrino. I don't use it as a reference any more, but keep it for sentimental reasons.

Written in 1999, it covers all the things that made JavaScript popular at that time. Image manipulation, scrolling status bars, Java plugins, etc.

It even cover cookies: <em>the first real instance of JavaScript state management.</em>
