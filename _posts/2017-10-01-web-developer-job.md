<em>Author's note: as previously mentioned, I lost my blog data due to not knowing what I was doing with databases. With the help of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Internet Wayback Machine</a>, I was able to recover all but two blog posts.</em>

<em>This was one of the two and while it didn't receive tons of traffic, it was well-received post that I'm really proud of from a journalistic standpoint. Thankfully, I spent so much time re-reading it while proofreading it that I recall enough of it from memory to rewrite it.</em>

<em>Since its publish date, I've talked to more recruiters, hiring managers and developer friends. I'm updating it with this new info and indicated the updates.

And as a heads-up: it's not the best time for code bootcamp grads looking for high-paying jobs.  At least, the time of this re-post.</em>

After a brief bout of unemployment, I'll be starting a new front end web developer job this week.  I'll be using my current skillset while ramping up on new ones...really exciting stuff!

I went through an intense job search process to get to this point, more so than ever before.  I learned a lot (a WHOLE lot) about the current web dev hiring process so I'll share my random thoughts on the process.

<h2>A preamble...like I start all my blog posts</h2>
For all the nervousness and anxiety that comes with unemployment, I knew I'd get a job sooner than later. I may not know everything about about front end web development but know enough so that I wouldn't be out of work for TOO long...only a month in the end.

But I also knew my limited experience with the currently in-demand frameworks (React, Angular, etc) meant I would have to work harder than most at finding a job. I'd used them in personal projects but had little on-the-job experience with them on my resum&eacute;

<a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/">Zach Holman's awesome <em>"Startup Interviewing Is F**cked"</em></a> article also prepared me for what I was about to go through. It discusses how some interviewers questions want interviewees to give perfect answers to specific tech questions, and how that's a poor indicator of whether or not someone can do the job.

I kept all this in mind for each interview I went on...not just startup ones. Here's the list of what I learned and I'll start of positive...

<h2>You WILL find a front end web developer job...</h2>
If you have web dev experience, you will find a front end web dev job. You may encounter rejections in the process, from jobs you really want and from jobs you thought you were going to get.

But as long as you have quantifiable web dev experience, you will get a web dev job. End of story.

<h2>...But how fast you get one will depend on your library/framework experience</h2>
I tweeted this once in 2016:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For a JavaScript developer, Angular is like cleaning out your garage. Procrastinate all you want but youâ€™ll have to deal with it eventually.</p>&mdash; kai gittens (@kaidez) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaidez/status/684336335050641408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In 2016, you can swap "Angular" out for for "React". And in a few months, you might be able to swap it out for "Vue".

<em><strong>UPDATE</strong>: React and Angular 2/4/5 are neck-in-neck for the most desirable skillsets among hiring managers...Vue is catching up, but not as fast as I thought it would.</em>

Experience with various the JavaScript frameworks and libraries are what hiring managers are looking for in 2017. Again, I was only unemployed for a month, but that would have been two weeks had I more React/Angular/whatever experience.

There's a lot of strife-laden debate in the front end web developer community about JavaScript frameworks and libraries.  About how too many are coming out too fast, and if we really REALLY need them.

But it's absolutely fair for potential employees to insist you know specific frameworks/libraries if you want to work for them.  So sorry, but you need to learn some specific frameworks/libraries in 2017.

A developer with at least a year of experience with a given framework is <em>the</em> most employable candidate in 2017. And companies are willing spend money to hire them, and keep them there for as long as possible.

<h2>Use your time off learn those frameworks and libraries</h2>
If you need to ramp up on those framework, do just with the current block of free time you have.  On my first day of unemployment, I went to a Starbucks and went through a ton of online React tutorials.

Next, I went through <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux">those kick-a** free Redux tutorials on Egghead</a>. After that, I had enough confidence to list React/Redux as a skill set and started getting more interviews.

<em><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The Egghead course is taught by Redux creator Dan Abramov and is worth watching. But if you're a Redux beginner, I would suggest watching <a href="https://learnredux.com/">Wes Bos' free Redux course</a> first. It holds your hand a bit more and also discusses how to use Redux inside React, not just Redux.</em>

<h2>Your plain JavaScript knowledge matters </h2>
Every job I applied for listed JavaScript as a required skillset. Not React or Angular or Vue...JavaScript.

Frameworks are important but understanding how to use them in the JavaScript context is much, much more important.

<h2>You need to know CSS better than you may think</h2>
Generally speaking, CSS is easier and more manageable than JavaScript. But hiring managers expect front web developers to have above-average CSS knowledge.

The integrity of CSS codebase can deteriorate over time. People come and go from a project,
