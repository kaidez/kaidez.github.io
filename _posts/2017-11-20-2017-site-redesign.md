I lost my WordPress blog because I deleted the database by mistake. So I had to rebuild it quickly to keep from losing the little "<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/link-juice-improving-google-ranking-with-links/">link juice</a>" I have.

My day job's kept me busy, making me work some late nights and (sometimes) on the weekend. Consequently, I haven't had time to document this 2018 rebuilding process until now...towards the end of 2018.

<h2>Developing with the K.I.S.S. Method</h2>
This was, above all, the core foundation of my web development process.  K.I.S.S.: Keep It Simple, Stupid.

I've been lucky enough to work for a variety of great companies over the course of my career. From this variety, I've learned that I work best on teams that prefer simplicity in web development over trend-chasing.

This is not to say I don't try and learn new stuff: I do that in the evening hours. But while on the job, I prefer web dev tools and techniques that let me get the job done fast instead of the ones trending on Twitter at the time.

Hence, this is how I approached redesigning my blog: I (mostly) use what I needed to get things done.  I didn't want to do complex coding things just so I could say "I did complex coding things."
