On August 26th 2025, Stanford University released a report on how generative AI, or AI, is affecting the labor market.  It had six key findings, the first being that there were "substantial declines in employment for early-career workers (ages 22-25) in occupations most exposed to AI."

According to the report's findings, software development was listed as one of the most exposed career fields. So, for now, young entry-level workers should consider gaining tech experience before pursuing their first real technology job.
