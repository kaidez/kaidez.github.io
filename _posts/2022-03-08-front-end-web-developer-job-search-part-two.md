I wrote a fun post about <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a web development job in 2017</a>. Five days to the day later, I'm publishing a post about looking for a web dev job in 2022.

Things have changed over those five years...not only with web dev jobs, but also with the world. It may be a great time to look for a web developer job, but the tragedy of Covid-19 is what got us to that point.

<h2>The last time I looked for a web developer job</h2>
When I was job hunting five years ago, I "casted a wide net," meaning I applied for a WHOLE lot of jobs in a short time. So much so that there was a day when I had four interviews in one day.

I felt I had to this because I had little experience with current crop of in-demand JavaScript frameworks, particularly <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. I may have had a decade of web dev experience at the time, but was competing for jobs with people that had way more of the required framework experience than me.

So I casted that wide net to give myself a better chance of getting a web development job. But when I got that job at JPMorgan Chase, things changed for the better...experience-wise.

I was able to build five solid, quantifiable years of React experience at Chase...stateful/stateless components, Redux, hooks, etc. This paid off when I started looking for a new job.

As a result, I still casted a wide net in applied for a lot of jobs, but significantly less than the last time. I'm estimating that I applied for less then half the amount of jobs this time around.

Also, it took me four weeks to find a job five years ago. This time, it took less than three to find me new job at Blue Cross Blue Shield.

<h2>Always be aware of the core skills that are required for a job, and that list has changed dramatically</h2>

<h2>React is the most in-demand skill...and will stay that way for awhile</h2>

<h2>The algo tests matter</h2>

<h2>The line between a front end web dev job and a back end one is getting smaller</h2>

<h2>The line between a front end web dev job and a dev ops job is getting really REALLY small</h2>
