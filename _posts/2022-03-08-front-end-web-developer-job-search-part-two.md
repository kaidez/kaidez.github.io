I wrote a post about <a href="/front-end-web-developer-job-search/">looking for a web development job in 2017</a>. Five years to the day later, I'm publishing a post about looking for a web dev job in 2022.

This job search wasn't as intense as the previous one. But it was intense enough and like before, I learned a lot about what it takes to get a web dev position these days.

<h2>The last time I looked for a web developer job</h2>
When I was job hunting five years ago, I "cast a wide net," meaning I applied for a WHOLE lot of jobs in little time. So much so that there was a day when I went on four interviews in one day.

I felt I had to do that due to my little experience with the in-demand JavaScript frameworks of the day, particularly <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. I had over a decade of web dev experience, but was competing for jobs against people with much more of the required framework knowledge than me.

So I cast that wide net to give myself a stronger chance of getting a web development job. But once I got that job at JPMorgan Chase, my framework experience grew exponentially.

I built up five solid, quantifiable years of React experience at while working at Chase...stateful/stateless components, Redux, hooks, etc. And that paid off when I started looking for a new job.

Consequently, I still casted a wide net and applied for a lot of jobs during this new job search. But significantly less than before...less than half I believe.

Also, I found a job a bit faster. It took less than three weeks for me to get my new job at Blue Cross Blue Shield, compared to the four weeks it took for me to get my job at Chase.

As result, here's what I learned:

<h2>It's great time to look for a web developer job, but always respect that tragedy is what got us to that point.</h2>
Covid-19 is horrible: it's responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and led to massive lockdowns that have crippled small business.

It's also led to quarantining most office works and the need for more

<h2>Know the core skills required for a front web developer job, and that list always changes</h2>

<h2>React is the most in-demand skill...and will stay that way for awhile</h2>

<h2>The algo tests matter</h2>

<h2>The line between a frontend web dev job and a backend one is getting smaller</h2>

<h2>The line between a front end web dev job and a dev ops job is getting really REALLY small</h2>
