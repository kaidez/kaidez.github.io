<p>Using <code>npm run</code> to execute your project&#8217;s build tasks is an excellent alternative to tools like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. I have a personal project I work on in my free time (whenever that is) that uses <code>npm run</code> to run lots of tasks.</p><p>Setting it up in my project was easy and most tasks seem to run faster than if I had used Grunt or Gulp. And while I don&#8217;t see myself never using Grunt and Gulp again, using <code>npm run</code> will be first choice for my near future projects.</p><p>There have been a lot of great articles from the JavaScript community on this but some people prefer to learn through video. So I created a quick screencast on how I&#8217;m using <code>npm run</code> in my personal project.</p><p>I hope you watch the screencast but you should read those articles at some point because I&#8217;m basically putting their great content to video.
