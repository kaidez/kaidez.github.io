There is a cost for using AI. it may be too expensive to use exclusively learn a new language.

Great for unit testing...catches edge cases

Hiring a bunch of developers to code in AI will be expensive. a lot of request token will need to be bought, engery resources, etc.

MCPs are the thing to watch.

I'm im using Cline extension inside of Claude inside VS Code.  Claude plugin was a pain for me to configure.

That company that created an agent called Morpheus...that didn't help.
