There is a cost for using AI. it may be too expensive to use exclusively learn a new language.

Great for unit testing...catches edge cases

Clause fixed my 404 page semantically and help make responsive, which was a problem I knew about but didn't address.

Hiring a bunch of developers to code in AI will be expensive. a lot of request token will need to be bought, engery resources, etc.

MCPs are the thing to watch.

I'm im using Cline extension inside of Claude inside VS Code.  Claude plugin was a pain for me to configure.

That company that created an agent called Morpheus...that didn't help.

Yes, broken external links can harm your site's SEO by creating a poor user experience, tarnishing your site's reputation for being well-maintained, and potentially preventing link equity from passing to other sites. While Google's documentation doesn't explicitly state "broken external links hurt SEO," it confirms that 404 (Not Found) errors are a sign of poor site quality. Google's Search Console can help you find these errors, and tools like Screaming Frog can be used to audit your site regularly to fix them.
