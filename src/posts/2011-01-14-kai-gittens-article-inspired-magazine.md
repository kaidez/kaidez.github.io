I’m proud to announce that ***my first guest post ever*** can now be seen at [Inspired Magazine][1]. Titled “*[5 Survival Tips For Web Designers][2]*,” it’s my take on a heavily-debated Smashing Magazine article from late last year!

Thanks to Catalin Zorzini at Inspired Mag for the opportunity!!

I was supposed to post another jQuery related article but I was really excited to announce this!!! The jQuery article will appear next Monday….sorry for the delay.
