<em>(Author's note - August 2025: This is a diary-like entry I made after I created two courses for lynda.com, now LinkedIn Learning. I was a "cool" developer for a minute, so this posts exists for no other reason than historical perspective. -k)</em></p>

If you [follow me on Twitter/X](http://x.com/kaidez "follow kaidez on Twitter"), you know that I've been recording JavaScript-based courses for [lynda.com (now LinkedIn Learning)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). My second of two courses was uploaded to their site the day before this post's publish date.

My first course was ["Up and Running with Backbone.js"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-backbone-js/welcome "Check out 'Up and Running with Backbone.js' on lynda.com") while my second one was ["Up and Running with Ember.js"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-ember-js/welcome "Check out 'Up and Running with Ember.js' on lynda.com")...JavaScript MVC all around. As they're "Up and Running" courses, they're geared towards the intermediate JavaScript developer (although ANYONE with a LinkedIn Learning account can view them.)

Recording courses for lynda.com was an incredible experience and I hope to record more in the future. I've been a big fan of lynda.com ever since my employer, Revlon, paid for subscriptions for both myself and another staff web designer...so much so, that I paid for my own subscription out of my own pocket when my Revlon one wasn't renewed.

I'm deeply indebted to Lynda author [James Williamson (RIP, old friend)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/james-williamson?trk=lynda_redirect_learning "Visit James Williamson's lynda courses") for recommending me to be an author as well as content producer [Shira Gotshalk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiragotshalk/), who reviewed my demo and gave me a chance. James gave me a lot of great advice on putting courses together, as did authors [Ray Villalobos](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/ray-villalobos?trk=lynda_redirect_learning "Visit Ray Villalobos' lynda courses") and [Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/morten-rand-hendriksen?trk=lynda_redirect_learning "Visit Morten Rand-Hendriksen' lynda courses") so I thank those two as well.

I also throw great thanks to both [Scott Simpson](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/scott-simpson?trk=lynda_redirect_learning "Visit Scott Simpson's lynda courses") and [Dan Weston](https://x.com/danielbweston "visit Dan Weston on Twitter"), the respective producers of my Backbone and Ember courses. I may have prepared the course content but Scott and Dan provided invaluable advice on creating as best of a course as I could.

Check out the courses and [hit me up on Twitter/X](http://x.com/kaidez "contact kaidez on x") if you have any questions.
