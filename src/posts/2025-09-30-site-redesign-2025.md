It's been almost eight years since I updated kaidez.com's design and underlying code. Therefore, the time has come to update it.

This blog redesign features a clean, minimalist design built with the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" aria-label="Visit Eleventy static site generator">Eleventy (11ty)</a> static site generator. I also used <a href="https://claude.ai/" aria-label="Visit Claude AI assistant">Anthropic's Claude AI</a> as a pair programming partner throughout the development process.

<h2>The Design</h2>

My son and I have been collecting <a href="https://supreme.com/" aria-label="Visit Supreme: a high-end streetwear clothing brand">Supreme</a> t-shirts for the past few years. We frequently visit their website and admire its clean, crisp aesthetic.

So I drew inspiration from that aesthetic. As a result, this blog looks a whole lot like their site...ha!

I 'borrowed' their black/white/red color scheme and used the Courier font in key areas, just as they do. I also created the "Kaidez" top-left logo to give it that <a href="https://www.thebroad.org/art/barbara-kruger" aria-label="Learn about Barbara Kruger Supreme: am American conceptual artist">Barbara Kruger</a> Helvetica/Futura font look...hey, Supreme 'borrowed' it first!

<h2>Building this site with Eleventy (11ty)</h2>

With the exception of <a href="/site-redesign-2015/" aria-label="Read about the 2015 redesign of kaidez.com, done with WordPress">my 2015 site rebuild</a>, I've used the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" aria-label="Visit Jekyll: a Ruby-based static site generator">Jekyll static site generator</a> to create my blog. I had no real issues but wanted to try a new tool.

I picked Eleventy, or 11ty, and I'm glad I did! The build process is faster, the templating is more flexible, and the developer experience feels much more modern than Jekyll.

This is all because while Jekyll is powered by Ruby, 11ty is powered by JavaScript, specifically <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a>. And JavaScript's the workspace that I feel the most productive and comfortable in, developer-wise.



Anyone who knows me or has visited this blog before knows what a JavaScript fan I am.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>


There is a cost for using AI. it may be too expensive to use exclusively learn a new language.

Great for unit testing...catches edge cases

Claude fixed my 404 page semantically and help make responsive, which was a problem I knew about but didn't address.

Hiring a bunch of developers to code in AI will be expensive. a lot of request tokens will need to be bought, energy resources, etc.

MCPs are the thing to watch.

I'm im using Cline extension inside of Claude inside VS Code.

That company that created an agent called Morpheus...that didn't help.

Yes, broken external links can harm your site's SEO by creating a poor user experience, tarnishing your site's reputation for being well-maintained, and potentially preventing link equity from passing to other sites. While Google's documentation doesn't explicitly state "broken external links hurt SEO," it confirms that 404 (Not Found) errors are a sign of poor site quality. Google's Search Console can help you find these errors, and tools like Screaming Frog can be used to audit your site regularly to fix them.
