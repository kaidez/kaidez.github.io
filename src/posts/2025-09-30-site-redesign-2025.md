It's been almost eight years since I updated kaidez.com's design and underlying code. Therefore, the time has come to update it.

This blog redesign features a clean, minimalist design built with the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" aria-label="Visit Eleventy static site generator">Eleventy (11ty)</a> static site generator. I also used <a href="https://claude.ai/" aria-label="Visit Claude AI assistant">Anthropic's Claude AI</a> as a pair programming partner throughout the development process.

<h2>The Design</h2>

My son and I have been collecting <a href="https://supreme.com/" aria-label="Visit Supreme: a high-end streetwear clothing brand">Supreme</a> t-shirts for the past few years. We frequently visit their website and admire its clean, crisp aesthetic.

So I drew inspiration from that aesthetic. As a result, this blog looks a whole lot like their site...ha!

I 'borrowed' their black/white/red color scheme and used the Courier font in key areas, just as they do. I also created the "Kaidez" top-left logo to give it that <a href="https://www.thebroad.org/art/barbara-kruger" aria-label="Learn about Barbara Kruger: an American conceptual artist">Barbara Kruger</a> Helvetica/Futura font look...hey, Supreme 'borrowed' it first!

<h2>Building this site with Eleventy (11ty)</h2>

With the exception of <a href="/site-redesign-2015/" aria-label="Read about the 2015 redesign of kaidez.com, done with WordPress">my 2015 site rebuild</a>, I've used the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" aria-label="Visit Jekyll: a Ruby-based static site generator">Jekyll static site generator</a> to create my blog. I had no real issues with it but wanted to try a new tool.

I picked Eleventy, or 11ty, and I'm glad I did! Because while Jekyll runs on Ruby, 11ty runs on JavaScript, specifically <a href="https://nodejs.org/" aria-label="Visit Node.js website">Node</a>. 

Anyone who knows me or reads this blog knows JavaScript is where I'm most productive and comfortable.

The build process is faster, the templating is more flexible, and the developer experience feels much more modern than Jekyll.
