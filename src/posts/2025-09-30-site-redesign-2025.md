It's been almost eight years since I updated this site's design and underlying code. Therefore, the time has come to update it.

This blog redesign features a clean, minimalist design built with the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" aria-label="Visit Eleventy static site generator">Eleventy (11ty)</a>static site generator. I also used <a href="https://claude.ai/" aria-label="Visit Claude AI assistant">Anthropic's Claude AI</a> as a pair programming partner throughout the development process.

<h2>The Design</h2>

My son and I have been collecting <a href="https://supreme.com/" aria-label="Visit Supreme: a high-end streetwear clothing brand">Supreme</a> t-shirts together for the past few years. We frequently visit their website and admire its clean, crisp aesthetic.

So I "took inspiration" from that aesthetic. As a result, this blog looks a whole lot like their site...ha!

I "borrowed" their black/white/red color scheme and used the Courier font in certain spots (like them). I also created the "Kaidez" top-left logo  and the wide spacing of text.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>




There is a cost for using AI. it may be too expensive to use exclusively learn a new language.

Great for unit testing...catches edge cases

Claude fixed my 404 page semantically and help make responsive, which was a problem I knew about but didn't address.

Hiring a bunch of developers to code in AI will be expensive. a lot of request tokens will need to be bought, energy resources, etc.

MCPs are the thing to watch.

I'm im using Cline extension inside of Claude inside VS Code.

That company that created an agent called Morpheus...that didn't help.

Yes, broken external links can harm your site's SEO by creating a poor user experience, tarnishing your site's reputation for being well-maintained, and potentially preventing link equity from passing to other sites. While Google's documentation doesn't explicitly state "broken external links hurt SEO," it confirms that 404 (Not Found) errors are a sign of poor site quality. Google's Search Console can help you find these errors, and tools like Screaming Frog can be used to audit your site regularly to fix them.
