<p>
  Using <code>npm run</code> 
  to execute your project's build tasks is an excellent alternative to tools like 
  <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> 
  and 
  <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. 
  I have a personal project I work on in my free time (whenever that is) that uses 
  <code>npm run</code> 
  to run lots of tasks.
</p>

<p>
  Setting it up in my project was easy and most tasks seem to run faster than if I had used Grunt or Gulp. And while I don't see myself never using Grunt and Gulp again, using 
  <code>npm run</code> 
  will be first choice for my near future projects.
</p>

<p>
  There have been a lot of great articles from the JavaScript community on this but some people prefer to learn through video. So I created a quick screencast on how I'm using 
  <code>npm run</code> 
  in my personal project.
</p>

<p>
  I hope you watch the screencast but you should read those articles at some point because I'm basically putting their great content to video. Here they are:
