I used generative AI (or AI) to <a href="/site-redesign-2025/">redesign my blog in 2025</a>. Along the way, I spent time considering AI's long-term impact on the software development process.

I'm still learning coding using tools like <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>. But right now, I cautiously believe AI will be a permanent part of software development, and don't think that's bad.

<h2 id="ai-tools-and-tasks">My AI Coding Tools & Their Tasks</h2>

As mentioned in my 2025 blog update post, I used Claude as a coding assistant that was integrated into VS Code. Also, I used the <a href="https://cline.bot/">Cline plugin for VS Code</a>, which is a "swiss army knife" for Large Language Models (LLMs).

In other words, Cline lets you use whatever LLM you want inside VS Code: Claude, Chat GPT, Google Gemini, etc.  I tried various LLMs but stuck with Claude since it's the one most-favored by developers.

I used AI tooling for various tasks, and I'll discuss them all. But the core tasks were:

<ul>
  <li>Installing <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy (11ty)</a> as a static site generator.</li>
  <li>Reviewing my blog posts for clarity.</li>
  <li>Making sure my blog was both SEO-friendly an accessible as per <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG accessibility standards</a>.</li>
  <li>Helping me fix code when I asked AI for it.</li>
</ul>

Claude makes mistakes like any other LLM. In fact, its very honest about it once you log on:
