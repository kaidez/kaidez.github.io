It's been almost eight years since I updated kaidez.com's design and underlying code. Therefore, the time has come to update it.

This blog redesign features a clean, minimalist design built with the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" aria-label="Visit Eleventy static site generator">Eleventy (11ty)</a> static site generator. I also used <a href="https://claude.ai/" aria-label="Visit Claude AI assistant">Anthropic's Claude AI</a> as a pair programming partner throughout the development process.

<h2>The Design</h2>

My son and I have been collecting <a href="https://supreme.com/" aria-label="Visit Supreme: a high-end streetwear clothing brand">Supreme</a> t-shirts for the past few years. We frequently visit their website and admire its clean, crisp aesthetic.

So I drew inspiration from that aesthetic. As a result, this blog looks a whole lot like their site...ha!

I 'borrowed' their black/white/red color scheme and used the Courier font in key areas, just as they do. I also created the current "Kaidez" site logo to look like their's, giving it that <a href="https://www.thebroad.org/art/barbara-kruger" aria-label="Learn about Barbara Kruger: an American conceptual artist">Barbara Kruger</a> Helvetica/Futura font look...hey, Supreme 'borrowed' it first!

<h2>Building this site with Eleventy (11ty)</h2>

With the exception of <a href="/site-redesign-2015/" aria-label="Read about the 2015 redesign of kaidez.com, done with WordPress">my 2015 site rebuild</a>, I've used the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" aria-label="Visit Jekyll: a Ruby-based static site generator">Jekyll static site generator</a> to create my blog. I had no real issues with it but wanted to try a new tool.

I picked Eleventy, or 11ty, and I'm glad I did! Because while Jekyll runs on Ruby, 11ty runs on JavaScript, specifically <a href="https://nodejs.org/" aria-label="Visit the Node.js website">Node</a>. 

Anyone who knows me or reads this blog knows JavaScript's the web development environment where I'm most productive. As a result of that, configuring 11ty was ~mostly~ easy for me.

11ty is low-config out of the box, but it has an `.eleventy.js` file where you add your own customizations. Using that, I was able to add configs for a custom related posts section, XML sitemap building, building separate category & tag pages, and minifying code before production deployments.

Also, when compared to Jekyll, 11ty's build process is faster. And while its templating is similar to Jekyll's, 11ty's more flexible.

{# However, for all the cheerleading I'm doing about 11ty's ease of use, none of it would have been easy without Claude AI. I'll get into all that later on. #}

<h2>Still Hosting GitHub Pages</h2>

kaidez.com is still hosted on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages" aria-label="Visit GitHub Pages: a free web site hosting service from GitHub">GitHub Pages</a>. I considered switching but I decided not to.

The main reason for not switching is because GitHub Pages now allows for HTTPS hosting. They didn't when I first signed up and that was an issue for me, but they support now.

At that point, the only real reason I consider switching was because at the the time of this blog post, GH Pages doesn't allow for custom `htaccess` setups.  So doing things to speed up site-loading, like setting cache limits for images, CSS/JS files, etc. wasn't possible.

From a programming stand point, it was real easy for me to account for a lack of an `htaccess` file.  I minified all my code and used `preload` and `defer` attributes in, respectively, the CSS and JS files that were inside the `<head>` tag.

Also, I didn't create a bunch of JavaScript the executes at runtime: that keeps things fast. There's some JS that dynamically loads the current year at the end of the copyright in the footer along with some other code that manages the showing/hiding of the navigation on mobile, but that's it.

<h2>Considered Hosting On Netlify</h2>

When I <em>did</em> consider switching hosts, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" aria-label="Visit Netlify: an AI-friendly platform for building websites and web applications">Netlify</a> was the only hosting service I seriously looked at. Along with its `htaccess` support, Netlify offers a CDN, allows for multiple deployment setups and allows for a lot of cool server configurations.

Netlify is also really AI-friendly and that made me curious...you may want to read <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/build/build-with-ai/overview/" aria-label="Read Netlify's documentation for building sites and apps with AI">how Netlify supports building sites and apps with AI</a>. I still passed on signing up with them but may sign up with them in the future.

And speaking of being "AI-friendly"...

<h2>"Pair Programming" With Claude AI</h2>

Web and software development with AI is a hot-button issue at the time of this post. And I have a lot to say about it, and I will in future blog posts.

But for now, all I'll say is: I like coding with AI. And I get why it's a hot-button topic.
