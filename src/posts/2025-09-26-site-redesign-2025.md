It's been almost eight years since I updated kaidez.com's design and underlying code. Therefore, the time has come to update it.

This blog redesign features a clean, minimalist design built with the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy (11ty) static site generator</a>. I also used <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude AI</a> as a pair programming partner while coding, but <a href="https://www.augmentcode.com/">Cline AI</a> helped out a bit.

<h2 id="design">The Design</h2>

For the past few years, my son and I have been bonding by collecting <a href="https://supreme.com/">Supreme</a> t-shirts together. We frequently visit their website and admire its clean, crisp aesthetic.

So I drew inspiration from that aesthetic. As a result, this blog looks a whole lot like their site...ha!

I 'borrowed' their black/white/red color scheme and used the Courier font in key areas, just as they do. I also created the current "Kaidez" site logo to look like their's, giving it that <a href="https://www.thebroad.org/art/barbara-kruger">Barbara Kruger</a> Helvetica/Futura font look...hey, Supreme 'borrowed' it first!

<h2 id="eleventy">Building this site with Eleventy (11ty)</h2>

With the exception of <a href="/site-redesign-2015/">my 2015 site rebuild</a>, I've used the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a> to create my blog. I had no real issues with it but wanted to try a new tool.

I picked Eleventy, or 11ty, and I'm glad I did! Because while Jekyll runs on Ruby, 11ty runs on JavaScript, specifically <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a>. 

Anyone who knows me or reads this blog knows JavaScript's the web development environment where I'm most productive. As a result of that, configuring 11ty was ~mostly~ easy for me.

11ty is low-config out of the box, but it has an `.eleventy.js` file where you add your own customizations. Using that, I was able to add configs for a custom related posts section, XML sitemap building, building separate category & tag pages, and minifying code before production deployments.

Also, when compared to Jekyll, 11ty's build process is faster. And while its templating is similar to Jekyll's, 11ty's more flexible.

<h2 id="github-pages">Still Hosting On GitHub Pages</h2>

kaidez.com is still hosted on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a>. I considered switching but I decided not to.

The main reason for not switching is because GitHub Pages now allows for HTTPS hosting. They didn't when I first signed up and that was an issue for me, but they support it now.

At that point, the only real reason I considered switching was because at the time of this blog post, GH Pages doesn't allow for custom `htaccess` setups.  So doing things to speed up site-loading, like setting cache limits for static files and enabling gzip compression, wasn't possible.

From a programming stand point, it was real easy for me to account for a lack of an `htaccess` file.  I minified all my code and used `preload` and `defer` attributes in, respectively, the CSS and JS files that were inside the `<head>` tag.

Also, I didn't create a bunch of JavaScript that executes at runtime: that keeps things fast. There's some JS that dynamically loads the current year at the end of the copyright in the footer along with some other code that manages the showing/hiding of the navigation on mobile, but that's it.

<h2 id="netlify">Considered Hosting On Netlify</h2>

When I <em>did</em> consider switching hosts, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> was the only hosting service I seriously looked at. Along with its `htaccess` support, Netlify offers a CDN, allows for multiple deployment setups and allows for a lot of cool server configurations.

Netlify is also really AI-friendly and that made me curious...you may want to read <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/build/build-with-ai/overview/">how Netlify supports building sites and apps with AI</a>. I still passed on signing up with them but may sign up with them in the future.

And speaking of being "AI-friendly"...

<h2 id="using-claude-and-cline">"Pair Programming" With Claude AI & Cline</h2>

Web and software development with AI is a hot-button issue at the time of this post. And I have a lot to say about it, and will in at least one future blog post.

For now, all I'll say is: coding with the help of AI isn't a perfect process, but I like it. And I get why it's a hot-button issue.

As mentioned, I used Anthropic's Claude as a pair programming partner. I added it as a plugin for my <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> setup, along with Augment's Cline plugin.

I was thoroughly impressed!!! I used it for the following tasks:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>JavaScript Unit Tests</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
