If you’re a self-taught JavaScript developer like me, you may not be doing JavaScript unit testing. Self-taught JS developers tend to jump right into coding and skip learning software development fundamentals…like unit testing.

The best way to learn JavaScript unit testing is to realize you should write code in a functional programming style. Functional programming (or, FP) encourages writing small, easy-to-read functions, which are easy to test.
