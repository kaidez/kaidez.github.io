<h1>Web Components: Template &amp; (some) Shadow DOM Practice</h1><p>This is some really simple Web Components code I hacked together, just so I could better understand how WC works. It mainly focuses on templates but also uses a little Shadow DOM.</p><p><a href="https://kaidez.com/samples/template-shadowdom-practice/">View the demo!!! Â»</a></p><p>The code is documented in both <code>index.html</code> <a href="https://github.com/kaidez/template-shadowdom-practice/blob/master/index.html">here</a> and <code>scripts/main.js</code> <a href="https://github.com/kaidez/template-shadowdom-practice/blob/master/scripts/main.js">here</a>, so you MIGHT have a enough info to start using the code right now. But for an in-depth look at the code, view this blog post here (blog post will be available on August 13th, 2014 at about 7 AM US Easter Standard Time).</p><p>-kdz</p>
