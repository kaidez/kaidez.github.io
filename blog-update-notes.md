There is a cost for using AI. it may be too expensive to use exclusively learn a new language.

Great for unit testing...catches edge cases

Claude fixed my 404 page semantically and help make responsive, which was a problem I knew about but didn't address.

Hiring a bunch of developers to code in AI will be expensive. a lot of request tokens will need to be bought, energy resources, etc.

MCPs are the thing to watch.

I'm im using Cline extension inside of Claude inside VS Code.

Yes, broken external links can harm your site's SEO by creating a poor user experience, tarnishing your site's reputation for being well-maintained, and potentially preventing link equity from passing to other sites. While Google's documentation doesn't explicitly state "broken external links hurt SEO," it confirms that 404 (Not Found) errors are a sign of poor site quality. Google's Search Console can help you find these errors, and tools like Screaming Frog can be used to audit your site regularly to fix them.

I have successfully applied the title tag enhancement to improve the SEO of the JavaScript books post.

## Title Enhancement Applied:

**Before**: "5 Useful JavaScript Books"
**After**: "5 Best JavaScript Books for Developers (2024 Edition) - Beginner to Advanced"

## SEO Improvements from this Change:

### 1. **Enhanced Search Intent Targeting**
- Added "Best" (power word that matches common search queries)
- Included "for Developers" (specifies target audience)
- Added "(2024 Edition)" for freshness signals
- Included "Beginner to Advanced" to indicate content range

### 2. **Better Keyword Optimization**
The new title targets multiple high-value search terms:
- "best javascript books" (high volume keyword)
- "javascript books for developers" (specific audience)
- "javascript books 2024" (current/fresh content)
- "beginner to advanced javascript" (learning progression)

### 3. **Improved Click-Through Rate Potential**
- More descriptive and compelling title
- Clearly communicates value proposition
- Indicates comprehensive coverage (beginner to advanced)
- Year inclusion suggests up-to-date content

This single change significantly improves the post's SEO potential by making it more discoverable for relevant search queries while maintaining the original content's quality and structure. The enhanced title better matches how developers actually search for JavaScript book recommendations online.

This comprehensive approach would transform the post from a basic book list into an SEO-optimized resource hub for JavaScript book recommendations.





## JSON-LD Schema Recommendations for Your Tutorial Post

You're spot on - **JSON-LD is superior to microdata** for SEO. Since your site already uses JSON-LD, here are the specific schema types I'd recommend for your jQuery tutorial:

### Primary Schema: `HowTo`
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "Simple jQuery Image Fade In/Fade Out With A Delay",
  "description": "Learn how to create smooth image transitions using jQuery's fadeIn, fadeOut, and delay functions",
  "totalTime": "PT15M",
  "supply": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToSupply",
      "name": "jQuery library"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToSupply", 
      "name": "Two images (GIF/JPEG/PNG)"
    }
  ],
  "tool": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToTool",
      "name": "Text editor"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToTool",
      "name": "Web browser"
    }
  ],
  "step": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Set up CSS positioning",
      "text": "Create unique CSS IDs for each image using display:none and position:absolute"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep", 
      "name": "Add jQuery library",
      "text": "Embed the jQuery library from jQuery.com CDN"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Write fade animation code",
      "text": "Use fadeIn(), delay(), and fadeOut() functions with proper timing"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Secondary Schema: `TechArticle`
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "TechArticle",
  "headline": "TUTORIAL: A Simple jQuery Image Fade In/Fade Out With A Delay",
  "description": "An easy jQuery tutorial to fade in and fade out two images with a delay",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Kai Gittens"
  },
  "datePublished": "2010-01-10",
  "dateModified": "2025-08-26",
  "programmingLanguage": "JavaScript",
  "dependencies": "jQuery 1.4.4"
}
```

### Why JSON-LD is Better:
- **Cleaner HTML**: No inline attributes cluttering your markup
- **Easier maintenance**: All schema in one place
- **Better parsing**: Google prefers JSON-LD format
- **Future-proof**: Easier to update schema without touching content

### SEO Benefits:
- **Rich snippets**: Potential for enhanced search results
- **Featured snippets**: Step-by-step format favored by Google
- **Programming language recognition**: Helps with technical search queries
- **Tutorial categorization**: Better understanding of content type

Since your site already has JSON-LD infrastructure, adding this schema should integrate seamlessly with your existing implementation!


DELETING PAGES

https://yoast.com/deleting-pages-from-your-site/

google search guidelines:
https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf

CLAUDE PROMPT EXAMPLE:
you're an expert on making tech blogs very SEO-friendly.  I have posts that have content that's currently irrelevant...they currently have the word "ARCHIVE" in their page titles.  I'd like to give them a tag that's on display and I'd like the tag to be semantically correct.  what do you suggest?

EXAMPLE RESPONSE OF THIS:

Based on my analysis of your blog structure, I found 29 posts with "ARCHIVE" in their titles from 2010-2011. Here are my SEO-friendly recommendations for tagging archived content:

## Semantic Archive Tag Options:

**1. "legacy" tag** (Recommended)
- SEO-friendly: indicates historical content that's still valuable
- Professional tone: suggests established, foundational knowledge
- Schema.org compatible: can be marked up as historical content

**2. "historical" tag**
- Clear semantic meaning for both users and search engines
- Indicates content of historical interest/context
- Good for tech evolution topics

**3. "foundational" tag**
- Positions old content as building blocks for current knowledge
- SEO-positive: suggests fundamental, important information
- Appeals to beginners learning the basics

## Implementation Strategy:

**Current Structure Analysis:**
- Your posts use both `tags` (primary) and `secondary_tags` arrays
- The post layout displays secondary_tags prominently
- You have a working tag system with dedicated tag pages

**Recommendation:**
Add `"legacy"` to the `secondary_tags` array in your archived posts' front matter. This will:

1. **Display visibly** on each post as a clickable tag
2. **Create SEO value** - search engines understand "legacy" as valuable historical content
3. **Improve user experience** - visitors know they're reading foundational content
4. **Maintain content discoverability** - creates a browsable archive collection
5. **Preserve SEO equity** - doesn't devalue content, just contextualizes it

**Example front matter update:**
```yaml
---
title: 10 WordPress Tips For Web Designers
secondary_tags: ["wordpress", "web design", "legacy"]
---
```

The "legacy" tag is semantically correct, SEO-friendly, and positions your archived content as valuable foundational knowledge rather than outdated information.





Then my follow-up question:

"That's really helpful. thanks so much! two more questions: does it matter if "legacy" be listed as the first tag or not? also, is their some documentation confirming your statement "search engines understand "legacy" as valuable historical content"?"



Great follow-up questions! Let me clarify both points:

## Tag Order Impact:

**Answer: Tag order typically doesn't matter for SEO**, but there are UX considerations:

1. **SEO perspective**: Search engines treat all tags equally regardless of order in your front matter array
2. **User experience**: Since your template displays tags in array order, consider placing "legacy" last so content-specific tags appear first
3. **Best practice**: Put topical tags first, contextual tags last

**Recommended order:**
```yaml
secondary_tags: ["wordpress", "web design", "legacy"]
```

## Documentation on "Legacy" Tag SEO Value:

**I need to correct my statement** - there isn't specific documentation that search engines have special understanding of "legacy" as valuable historical content. My recommendation was based on semantic best practices, not documented search engine behavior.

**More accurate reasoning:**

1. **Semantic clarity**: "Legacy" clearly communicates content status to both users and crawlers
2. **User intent matching**: Users searching "legacy WordPress tips" are specifically seeking historical content
3. **Content categorization**: Helps search engines understand your site's content taxonomy
4. **Avoids negative signals**: Unlike "outdated" or "deprecated," "legacy" doesn't signal low quality

**Alternative evidence-based approaches:**
- **"vintage-[year]"**: More specific (e.g., "vintage-2010")
- **"classic"**: Implies enduring value
- **"foundational"**: Suggests fundamental importance

The key is choosing terminology that accurately describes the content without suggesting it's obsolete or low-quality. "Legacy" remains my top recommendation for semantic accuracy and professional presentation, even without specific search engine documentation.

I've fixed the Nunjucks template JavaScript syntax error. The issue was that VSCode was trying to parse Nunjucks template syntax (`{{ tags | dump | safe }}`) as JavaScript, which caused syntax errors.

**The solution:**
1. **Moved template syntax out of JavaScript context**: Placed the Nunjucks template syntax in a `data-tags` attribute on the `<body>` element instead of directly in the JavaScript
2. **Clean JavaScript separation**: Replaced the problematic inline script with clean JavaScript that reads from the data attribute
3. **Added error handling**: Included try/catch with fallback values in case the JSON parsing fails or `tags` is undefined

**What changed:**
- Added `data-tags="{% if tags %}{{ tags | dump | safe }}{% else %}[]{% endif %}"` to the body element
- Replaced the problematic script with clean JavaScript that safely reads and parses the data attribute:
  ```javascript
  try {
      const tagsData = document.body.getAttribute('data-tags');
      window.pageData = {
          tags: tagsData ? JSON.parse(tagsData) : []
      };
  } catch (e) {
      console.warn('Failed to parse tags data, using empty array');
      window.pageData = { tags: [] };
  }
  ```

This approach follows best practices for passing server-side data to client-side JavaScript and should eliminate the VSCode syntax errors you were experiencing while maintaining the same functionality.


WHAT IS CLAUDE GOOD AT:

* unit testing
* WCAG compliance
* HTTP/2 compliance

SCHEMA INFO


  For the site redesign post:
  ---
  title: "Kaidez 2025 Site Redesign"
  schema_type: "TechArticle"
  dependencies: "Eleventy, Node.js, Claude AI, GitHub Pages"
  proficiency_level: "Intermediate"
  ---

  For tutorial posts:
  ---
  title: "jQuery Image Fade Tutorial"
  schema_type: "HowTo"
  total_time: "PT15M"
  supplies: ["jQuery library", "Two images"]
  tools: ["Text editor", "Web browser"]
  steps:
    - name: "Set up CSS"
      text: "Create CSS positioning for images"
    - name: "Add jQuery"
      text: "Include jQuery library"
  ---

  For regular posts: Just omit schema_type and it defaults to BlogPosting.

> looks great!  one question, what does the "total_time: "PT15M" mean in the above example?

⏺ PT15M is the ISO 8601 duration format that Schema.org requires for time values.

  PT15M breakdown:
  - P = Period (required prefix)
  - T = Time (separates date from time components)
  - 15M = 15 minutes

  Other examples:
  - PT30M = 30 minutes
  - PT1H = 1 hour
  - PT2H30M = 2 hours 30 minutes
  - PT45S = 45 seconds
  - P1D = 1 day

  For your site redesign post, you might use something like PT1H (1 hour) or PT2H (2 hours)
  depending on how long you estimate it would take someone to follow your process.

> is this a firm Schema.org requirement?

⏺ Yes, it's a firm Schema.org requirement. The duration property specifically requires ISO
  8601 duration format.

  From Schema.org documentation, duration values must be in the format defined by ISO 8601.
  Search engines like Google will not properly parse other formats like "15 minutes" or "1
  hour".

  If you don't provide the correct format, the schema validation will fail and search
  engines won't recognize the duration property for rich snippets or enhanced search
  results.

> in the context of this discussion, you said "follow your process." Does that have the same 
  meaning as "read"?

⏺ No, they have different meanings in this context:

  - "Read" = the time to read through your blog post (maybe 5-10 minutes)
  - "Follow your process" = the time to actually implement what you describe (redesigning a
  site with Eleventy, setting up Claude AI, etc.)

  For a HowTo schema, totalTime should reflect the time to complete the task, not just read
  about it.

  For your site redesign post, someone following your process might need:
  - PT8H (8 hours) for a basic implementation
  - PT2D (2 days) for a more thorough rebuild

  Since your post is more of a case study than a step-by-step tutorial, TechArticle schema
  (which you're already using) is actually more appropriate than HowTo.

> should every blog host have a PT value?

⏺ No, only specific schema types require totalTime with PT values:

  Schema types that need totalTime:
  - HowTo - time to complete the tutorial/process
  - Recipe - cooking/prep time
  - Course - duration of educational content

  Schema types that DON'T need totalTime:
  - BlogPosting - just a regular blog post
  - TechArticle - technical article/case study
  - Article - general article

  Your site redesign post uses TechArticle schema, so it doesn't need a totalTime field. The
   dynamic template I created only adds totalTime when schema_type is set to HowTo.

  Most of your blog posts will probably use BlogPosting or TechArticle and won't need PT
  duration values.

> ok.  so this post doesn't need it for now I think. but tutorials so

⏺ Exactly!

  Your site redesign post = TechArticle (no totalTime needed)

  Tutorial posts = HowTo (needs totalTime with PT format)

  So for future tutorial posts like "How to create jQuery image fades" you'd add:
  schema_type: "HowTo"
  total_time: "PT15M"

  But your current redesign post is perfect as-is with just TechArticle schema.
